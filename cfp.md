# Call for Papers

We welcome all original research papers of up to 4 pages in length,

references or any supplementary materials. Reviewers are *not* obliged
to read supplementary materials when reviewing the paper.  Submissions
should be a single file in `.pdf` format. The review process is

papers.

This workshop is **non-archival**; even though all accepted papers will be
