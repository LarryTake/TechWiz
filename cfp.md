# Call for Papers

We welcome all original research papers of up to 4 pages in length,
using the template provided [below](#style). This length does not include
references or any supplementary materials. Reviewers are *not* obliged
to read supplementary materials when reviewing the paper.  Submissions
should be a single file in `.pdf` format. The review process is
*double-blind*, so please ensure that all papers are appropriately
anonymized.

This workshop is **non-archival**; even though all accepted papers will be
available on OpenReview, there are *no* formally-published proceedings.

# Scope and topics

Please find a list of topics of interest, sorted alphabetically. If
you are not sure whether your topic might be a good fit for the
workshop, feel free to contact us at [workshop@topology.rocks](mailto:workshop@topology.rocks).

- **Approximations**: Can we approximate parts of the computational
  pipeline in topological data analysis, for example when calculating
  Vietoris--Rips complexes and their associated filtrations, or when
  calculating distances between persistence diagrams?

- **Benchmark data sets and software**: What are suitable benchmark data
  sets to quickly compare different topological data analysis, graph
  representation learning, and manifold learning methods in
  a reproducible manner? What are "our" MNIST or CIFAR data sets, and
  how do we go beyond them? How do the existing software tools in these
  fields measure up for ever-increasing data, and how do we address the
  software needs?

- **Scaling and parallel processing**: How can we scale implementations
  to the dataset sizes that we encounter in machine learning, with
  bigger graphs, data manifolds, or collections of many geometric
  "objects"?

- **Current and future applications**: In which projects and
  applications does the incorporation of topology and geometry
  information have decisive edge over alternative approaches, and how to
  identify relevant high-impact "niches" methodically?

- **Feature descriptors**: How can we employ geometric and topological
  descriptors in unsupervised or supervised machine learning scenarios?
  Which structural patterns are captured, or missed, by them and how can
  we improve their integration into representation learning frameworks?

- **Higher-order features**: In many applications, the theoretical
  richness of extracted geometric and topological features is limited in
  practice (e.g., restricting information to connected components, local
  similarity, and smoothness). What can we say about higher-order
  regularities or patterns? What would be the structural equivalent of
  considering textures rather than edges in images? When are they
  suitable, and how can we approximate these efficiently?
