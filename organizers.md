<img align="left" src="https://scholars.duke.edu/file/t5068122/thumb_image_5068122.jpg" alt="Xiuyuan Cheng" width="150">&nbsp;[**Xiuyuan Cheng**](https://services.math.duke.edu/~xiuyuanc/) is an assistant professor of mathematics at Duke University, with a secondary appointment in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Dr. Cheng is interested in theoretical and computational problems in high-dimensional data analysis and machine learning, particularly on spectral methods, kernel matrices, geometric data analysis, and deep neural networks. Dr. Cheng has co-organized the following academic events: 42nd SIAM Southeastern Atlantic Sectional Conference (SIAM-SEAS 2018) Co-organized with Jianfeng Lu (Duke), Alina Chertock & Mansoor Haider (NCState), Greg Forest & Katie Newhall (UNC Chapel Hill) Chapel Hill, NC, March 2018; SIAM mini-Symposium on “Computational Methods for Cryo-EM Single Particle Reconstruction” Co-organized with Prof. Zhizhen Zhao at UIUC Albuquerque, NM, May 2016.

<img align="left" src="https://tda-in-ml.github.io/assets/images/sk.jpg" alt="Smita Krishnaswamy" width="150">&nbsp;[**Smita Krishnaswamy**](https://www.krishnaswamylab.org) is an associated professor in the Departments of Genetics and Computer Science at the Yale University. She is also affiliated with Yale's Center for Biomedical Data Science, Cancer Center, and Applied Math Program. Her research focuses on developing representation learning methods (esp.\ graph signal processing and deep-learning) to denoise, impute, visualize and extract structure, patterns and relationships from big biomedical data. Her methods have been applied variety of datasets from many systems including embryoid body differentiation, EMT in breast cancer, lung cancer immunotherapy, infectious diseases, gut microbiome, and patient data. She has co-organized the Modeling of Biological Data (MOB) workshop co-located with the Design Automation Conference (DAC) in 2013, was co-chair of the technical program committee of the International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation in 2012 and has served on the technical program committee of several conferences including ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR,  Research on Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB), ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology  and Health Informatics (ACMBCB), Design Automation Conference, and PSB Cancer Panomics. In addition, her lab offers a week-long bootcamp workshop on Machine Learning for Single Cell Analysis (krishnaswamylab.org/workshop) on an annual basis.

<img align="left" src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/images/jure-2b.jpg" alt="Jure Leskovec" width="150">&nbsp;[**Jure Leskovec**](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/) is an associate professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, chief scientist at Pinterest, and investigator at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. His research focuses on machine learning in large social, information, and biological networks, their evolution, and the diffusion of information over them. His research has won several awards including a Lagrange Prize, Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship, the Alfred P.\ Sloan Fellowship, and 14 best paper awards. He received his bachelor's degree in computer science from University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and his PhD in machine learning from Carnegie Mellon University and postdoctoral training at Cornell University. In recent years, he has published extensively on graph representation learning, including a popular review paper, invited talks at ICLR and KDD, and a tutorial on the subject at WWW 2018.
He has extensive experience organizing conferences, with prominent examples including KDD 2014 (program chair), ICDM 2011 (tutorial chair), and WWW 2010 (chair of ML \& DM track). More recently, he co-organized a series of successful workshops on representation learning with graphs at NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML. 

<img align="left" src="https://tda-in-ml.github.io/assets/images/br.jpg" alt="Bastian Rieck" width="150">&nbsp;[**Bastian Rieck**](https://bastian.rieck.me) is a senior assistant in the Machine Learning and Computational Biology Lab of the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. He holds an M.Sc. degree in mathematics and a Ph.D. in computer science from Heidelberg University, Germany. While broadly interested in investigating graph classification and time series analysis from a topological perspective, Bastian is also fascinated by explaining neural networks using concepts from algebraic and differential topology. Moreover, he is particularly drawn to applications in personalized medicine, such as antimicrobial resistance prediction and detection of sepsis in ICU patients. Bastian recently organized a tutorial on topological machine learning for ECML, the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, as well as a workshop on Topological Data Analysis & Beyond at NeurIPS 2020.

<img align="left" src="https://www.ams.jhu.edu/villar/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-soledad-2.jpg" alt="Soledad Villar" width="150">&nbsp;[**Soledad Villar**](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/villar/) is an assistant professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics \& Statistics, and Mathematical Institute for Data Science at Johns Hopkins University. Her research involves computational and mathematical aspects of extracting information from data, with emphasis on optimization algorithms for processing data with theoretical guarantees. She is particularly interested in deep generative models, graph neural networks, and optimization techniques for signal processing. Part of her research focuses on clustering, dimensionality reduction, and quadratic assignment problems with applications to computational biology. She has been involved in the organization of several conferences, such as DeepMath 2020 and MSML 2020.
