[**Bastian Rieck**](https://bastian.rieck.me) is a senior assistant in the Machine Learning and Computational Biology Lab of the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. He holds an M.Sc. degree in mathematics and a Ph.D. in computer science from Heidelberg University, Germany. While broadly interested in investigating graph classification and time series analysis from a topological perspective, Bastian is also fascinated by explaining neural networks using concepts from algebraic and differential topology. Moreover, he is particularly drawn to applications in personalized medicine, such as antimicrobial resistance prediction and detection of sepsis in ICU patients. Bastian recently organized a tutorial on topological machine learning for ECML, the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, as well as a workshop on Topological Data Analysis & Beyond at NeurIPS 2020.

<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Guy Wolf**](http://guywolf.org) is an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the Université de Montréal and a Core Member of Mila - the Québec AI Institute. He is also affiliated with IVADO - the institute of data valorization at Montreal. His research focuses on manifold learning, representation learning, and geometric deep learning for exploratory data analysis, including methods for dimensionality reduction, visualization, denoising, data augmentation, and coarse graining, with particular focus on applications in biomedical data exploration. His recent organization activities include the CRM-IVADO Industrial Problem Solving Workshop (IPSW 2020), a two-part mini-symposium on geometric deep learning as part of the inaugural SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science held online in June 2020, and a NeurIPS 2020 workshop on Topological Data Analysis & Beyond.
