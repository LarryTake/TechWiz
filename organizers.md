His research focuses on machine learning in large social, information, and biological networks, their evolution, and the diffusion of information over them. His research has won several awards including a Lagrange Prize, Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship, the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and 14 best paper awards. He received his bachelor's degree in computer science from University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and his PhD in machine learning from Carnegie Mellon University and postdoctoral training at Cornell University. In recent years, he has published extensively on graph representation learning, including a popular review paper, invited talks at ICLR and KDD, and a tutorial on the subject at WWW 2018.
He has extensive experience organizing conferences, with prominent examples including KDD 2014 (program chair), ICDM 2011 (tutorial chair), and WWW 2010 (chair of ML & DM track). More recently, he co-organized a series of successful workshops on representation learning with graphs at NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML.
