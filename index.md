# Background

Over the past two decades, high-throughput data collection technologies
have become commonplace in most fields of science and technology, and
with them an ever-increasing amount of big high dimensional data is
being generated by virtually every real-world system. While such data
systems are highly diverse in nature, the underlying data analysis and
exploration task give rise to common challenges at the core of modern
representation learning. For example, even though modern real-world data
typically have high dimensional ambient measurement spaces, they often
exhibit low dimensional intrinsic structures that can be uncovered by
geometry-oriented methods, such as the ones encountered in manifold
learning, graph signal processing, geometric deep learning, and
topological data analysis. As a result, recent years have seen
significant interest and progress in geometric and topological
approaches to representation learning, which enable tractable
exploratory analysis by domain experts who are often not
computation-oriented.  Our overarching goal in the proposed workshop is
to deepen our understanding of the challenges and opportunities in this
field, while breaking the barriers between the typically disjoint
computational approaches (or communities) that work in this field, with
emphasis on the domains of topological data analysis, graph
representation learning, and manifold learning, on which we shall
subsequently briefly comment.
