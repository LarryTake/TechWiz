| **Foundations Talk on Topological Data Analysis** |
| This talk provides a short introduction to topological data analysis (TDA), a recent field in data sciences whose goal is to extract topological information from complex objects (graphs, time series, manifold). The presentation focuses on persistence diagrams (PDs), a very common topological descriptor, targeting statistical and learning applications. We present the standard metrics used to compare PDs and discuss their relation with Optimal Transport problems, an important connection when it comes to develop new theoretical and numerical tools in TDA. |

| **Few-Shot Learning for Network Biology** |
| Prevailing methods for graphs require abundant label and edge information for learning. However, labeled examples can be incredibly scarce for problems at the frontier of science. In this talk, I describe our efforts to expand the scope and ease the applicability of graph representation learning. First, I will outline G-Meta, a meta-learning algorithm for graphs. G-Meta quickly adapts to a new task using only a handful of nodes or edges in the new task and does so by learning from local subgraphs in other graphs or related, albeit disjoint, label sets.  G-Meta is theoretically justified as we show that the evidence for a prediction can be found in the local subgraph surrounding the target node or edge. Next, I will discuss applications. The new methods successfully predicted treatments for an emerging disease, which were later experimentally confirmed in the wet laboratory. Unlike previous methods, G-Meta successfully learns in few-shot settings that require generalization to completely new graphs and labels. Finally, G-Meta scales to large graphs, which we demonstrate on a dataset comprising 1,840 graphs spanning the tree of life, a two-orders of magnitude increase in the number of graphs used in prior work. |
