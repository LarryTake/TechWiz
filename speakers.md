| **Few-Shot Learning for Network Biology** |
| Prevailing methods for graphs require abundant label and edge information for learning. However, labeled examples can be incredibly scarce for problems at the frontier of science. In this talk, I describe our efforts to expand the scope and ease the applicability of graph representation learning. First, I will outline G-Meta, a meta-learning algorithm for graphs. G-Meta quickly adapts to a new task using only a handful of nodes or edges in the new task and does so by learning from local subgraphs in other graphs or related, albeit disjoint, label sets.  G-Meta is theoretically justified as we show that the evidence for a prediction can be found in the local subgraph surrounding the target node or edge. Next, I will discuss applications. The new methods successfully predicted treatments for an emerging disease, which were later experimentally confirmed in the wet laboratory. Unlike previous methods, G-Meta successfully learns in few-shot settings that require generalization to completely new graphs and labels. Finally, G-Meta scales to large graphs, which we demonstrate on a dataset comprising 1,840 graphs spanning the tree of life, a two-orders of magnitude increase in the number of graphs used in prior work. |
