<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Smita Krishnaswamy**](https://www.krishnaswamylab.org) is an associated professor in the Departments of Genetics and Computer Science at the Yale University. She is also affiliated with Yale's Center for Biomedical Data Science, Cancer Center, and Applied Math Program. Her research focuses on developing representation learning methods (esp. graph signal processing and deep-learning) to denoise, impute, visualize and extract structure, patterns and relationships from big biomedical data. Her methods have been applied variety of datasets from many systems including embryoid body differentiation, EMT in breast cancer, lung cancer immunotherapy, infectious diseases, gut microbiome, and patient data. She has co-organized the Modeling of Biological Data (MOB) workshop co-located with the Design Automation Conference (DAC) in 2013, was co-chair of the technical program committee of the International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation in 2012 and has served on the technical program committee of several conferences including ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR,  Research on Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB), ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology  and Health Informatics (ACMBCB), Design Automation Conference, and PSB Cancer Panomics. In addition, her lab offers a week-long bootcamp workshop on Machine Learning for Single Cell Analysis (krishnaswamylab.org/workshop) on an annual basis.

<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Bernadette Stolz**](https://www1.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/bernadette.stolz) is a researcher in the Centre for Topological Data Analysis at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford. She is interested in applying ideas from topology to study the shape of biological data and gain novel insights into complex biological processes. Before pursuing her DPhil, Bernadette obtained an MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing from the University of Oxford in 2014, as well as two undergraduate degrees from the University of Bern (BSc in Mathematics, 2012) and the University of Göttingen (BSc in Molecular Medicine, 2009). As part of her degrees she also spent time studying at Charles University in Prague (2011) and conducted two short research projects at the University of Cambridge (2008 and 2009).

| **Topological Data Analysis and Geometric Anomaly Detection** |
| Topological data analysis (TDA) refers to the mathematical field that studies 'shape' of data. Research in this area has attracted a lot of interest over the last two decades with an increasing range of applications to real-world data. The most prominent method in TDA is persistent homology (PH), an algorithm that computes topological features such as connected components (dimension 0), loops (dimension 1), and voids (dimension 2) and how they change across different scales in the data. These multi-scale topological features are summarised in structures called barcodes, which can be equipped with a metric that is stable with respect to small perturbations to the data. However, this metric alone is not suitable for integration with machine learning, which has lead to the development of stable vectorisation methods such as persistence landscapes and persistence images. In this talk I will give an introduction to TDA and, in particular, PH as well as different vectorisation methods.  I will further demonstrate how we can apply local computations of PH to successfully identify non-manifold regions in two completely different data sets whose underlying spaces do not follow the manifold hypothesis and are known to admit singularities. |

| **Topological Data Analysis of Collective Motion** |
| Collective behaviors abound anywhere in nature that objects or agents interact. Investigators modeling collective behavior face a variety of challenges involving data from simulation and/or experiment. These challenges include exploring large, complex data sets to understand and characterize the system, inferring the model parameters that most accurately reflect a given data set, and assessing the goodness-of-fit between experimental data sets and proposed models. Topological data analysis provides a lens through which these challenges may be addressed. I will highlight how topological techniques, sometimes in concert with machine learning, can be applied to models arising from the study of groups displaying collective motion, such as bird flocks, fish schools, and insect swarms. The key approach is to characterize a system's dynamics via the time-evolution of topological invariants called Betti numbers, accounting for persistence of topological features across multiple scales. |
