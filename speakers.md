<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Smita Krishnaswamy**](https://www.krishnaswamylab.org) is an associated professor in the Departments of Genetics and Computer Science at the Yale University. She is also affiliated with Yale's Center for Biomedical Data Science, Cancer Center, and Applied Math Program. Her research focuses on developing representation learning methods (esp. graph signal processing and deep-learning) to denoise, impute, visualize and extract structure, patterns and relationships from big biomedical data. Her methods have been applied variety of datasets from many systems including embryoid body differentiation, EMT in breast cancer, lung cancer immunotherapy, infectious diseases, gut microbiome, and patient data. She has co-organized the Modeling of Biological Data (MOB) workshop co-located with the Design Automation Conference (DAC) in 2013, was co-chair of the technical program committee of the International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation in 2012 and has served on the technical program committee of several conferences including ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR,  Research on Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB), ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology  and Health Informatics (ACMBCB), Design Automation Conference, and PSB Cancer Panomics. In addition, her lab offers a week-long bootcamp workshop on Machine Learning for Single Cell Analysis (krishnaswamylab.org/workshop) on an annual basis.
